## Key Points
right adj. 适当的, 合适的
- this job seems just right for you

make up one's mind + to/about 下定决心
- Have you made your mind about where to study
- Laura made up her mind to find a husband and get married

not yet尚未常用于否定句或疑问句中
- Helen has not decided what to do yet

Are you serious about studying violin

matter. 事情
- I sorry but I don't know anything about that matter

现在完成时:
- 也可以表示过去某时已完成的动
- 可以表示从过去某时一直持续到现在的动作

所以关键的逻辑就在于，要区分这个动作是持续的还是不可持续的（当与一段时间相结合时，语法会不一样）

假设你要用for + 一段时间的话，动词是要持续发生的
- He has lived here for ten years 
- He has learned English for five months
- It has rained for the past three weeks

如果没有持续发生的动词，要用一段时间修饰呢？应该使用 it is + 时间 + since
- It is ten years since he married Jane
- It is a month since he passed away
- It is ten days since he finished the work

当然还有一个办法就是。用have been 表示持续
- He has been dead for ten years
- He and Jane have been married for five years

然后since是自从...以后，可以表示从某个时间到现在一直在...，所以呢，主语可以用现在完成进行时，表示持续的一个状态
- He has been waiting for her since ten o'clock
- Since he moved here he has been learning English
- Since he moved here in 1990, he has been learning English

最后，现在完成时可以表示将来完成的动作，一般是跟if、when、as soon as、after结合使用。主句用将来时，然后连词用现在完成时，一般表示一旦...，就/才...
- If I have finished all the chores, I'll go fishing with you.
