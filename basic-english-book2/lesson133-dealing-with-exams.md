Examinations are an imprtant part of every student's life. Students must, therefore, know how to deal with them. 
There're three important things a student must do to get ready for an exam. First, he must work out a study plan.
Second, he must always keep his mind fresh by setting aside some time for exercise.

After all, success can only be achieved through hard work.
