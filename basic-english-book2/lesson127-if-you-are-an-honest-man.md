If you're honest, people will trust you. It's ipmrotant for a person to have a reputation for being honest. 
If a person is dishonest, no one will want to be his friends. He will soon become an outcast. 
On the other hand, an honest man wins the respect of others.
Honesty is, indeed, the best policy.

## Key Points
outcast. 被排斥的人
- he is always been an outcast

诚实为上策
- Honesty is the best policy. 

声誉：
- That restaurant has a reputation for good food and service

文中的 if 属于条件语句，因而时态是一般现在时。同时 if 还有虚拟语气的用法，同时跟现在、过去、未来有关

对现在的虚拟，表情况相反：if + were/或其他动词过去式, 主语用 would
- If John had money he would build a school
- If you were in my shoes what would you do 

对过去的虚拟，表情况相反：if + had + 过去分词，主语用 would/might + have
- If he had seen the result yesterday，he would have been disappointed 
- if I had met Jane ten years ago，I might have married her

对未来的虚拟（未来难预料，不能提前知道情况）：if + should，主语根据主观愿意区分 may/might，或 will/would
- 如果主观认为不太可能发生，使用 might/would：If it should rain tomorrow，we would cancel the picnic
- 如果主观认为很可能会发生，使用 may/will：If it should rain tomorrow，we will cancel the picnic
