Some people eat to live, but there're others who live to eat. To live a long and healthy life, we must learn to have a balanced diet.
A balanced diet simply means a bit of everything. A diet which includes meat, fish, vegetables and fruit is, of course, ideal.
If you watch your diet, then you won't have to suffer the pain of going on a diet.
