Computers are becoming a part of our everyday life. In fact, they'are almost everywhere.
In many countries, more and more companies are replacing people with computers. Telephone companies are no expection. 
When making a long-distance call on a pay phone in America, we no longer talk to an operator. 
Instead, a computer will answer. It will tell you what to do.
No wonder people say that computers are taking over the world.

当状语从句的主语跟主句的主语相同的时，可以首先删除从句中的主语，然后主语之后的动词变成现在分词，最后如果是be动词的话，可以变being，还可以省略。
