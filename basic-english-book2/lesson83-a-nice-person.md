Shelly doesn't like people who are unreliable. She especially doesn't like people who tell lies. 
On the other hand, she likes people who are humorous and honest. She really likes people that are easygoing and sincere. 
However, regardless of whom she likes or dislikes, she is nice to everyone.

## Key Points
unreliable 不值得依赖，不可靠的
- the car is unreliable, because it always breaks down

easygoing. adj 随遇而安的，从容不迫的
- you're too tense. you should be more easygoing. 你应该更轻松自在一些

sincere. adj. 诚恳的

regardless of. 无论，不管
- regardless of whom you're talking to, you should be more polite.

关系代词： who、whom、whose、which、that, 均为连词，引导定语从句

首先要明白，连词的作用，下面是个错误的例子：
- John is my good friends, he never lies. 错在何处？这是两个独立的句子，却仅用逗号分隔，无连词连接。

再看连词是怎么发挥作用的：

who 修饰人，在从语中作主语
- John is my good friend, who never lies.

whom 修饰人，在从语中作宾语
- John is my good friend, whom I trust.

whose 是所有格关系代词，代替 his/her/theirs/its，后面接名词
- He is John, whose father is my teacher.

which 修饰除了人以外的一切事物
- I love dogs, which are faithful to their masters.

that 可代替 who/whom/which，但 that 之前不可置逗号
- he is the man that you can trust
- he likes people that are easygoing and sincere
- where is the watch that I bought yesterday？

关系代词引导的定语从句，关键是前面有加不加逗号的区别：
- 不加逗号，属于限制性修饰。翻译时，先翻译定语从语, 再翻译被修饰的名词主语
- 加逗号，非限制性修饰。翻译时，先翻译名词主语，再翻译后面的定语从语。一般适用于名词本身有修饰、或专有名词的场景

示例：
- he is a person who never lies. 他是个从不说谎的人
- he is a gentleman, who never lies. 他是个君子，从不说谎

来看看专有名词，加与不加逗号的区别：
- here comes Mary, who is my girlfriend. 玛丽来了，她是我女友
- here comes Mary who is my girlfriend. 那个是我女友的玛丽来了（暗示还有女的叫玛丽）
