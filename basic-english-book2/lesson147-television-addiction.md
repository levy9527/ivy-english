Television provides us with a wide range of information and entertainment. 
However, it's a pity that it may also have a bad influence on young minds. 
For instance, some TV shows have too much violence（不可数） and crime（此句中不可数）. These programs may lead youngsters astray. 
It's easy for students to become addicted to the excitement of these programs and neglect their homework.
Parents, therefore, must keep an eye on what their chidlren watch.
