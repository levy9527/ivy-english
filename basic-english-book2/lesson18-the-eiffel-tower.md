Have you ever been to Paris?

No. I haven't.

Then you have never seen the Eiffel Tower?

No. I haven't.

What a pity.

## Key Points

去过：
- He has gone to Japan 他去了日本，人还在日本
- He has been to Japan 他曾去过日本，此刻不在日本

另：Have been to 多与频率副词 once twice 或者many times或者before 搭配
- He has been to Shanghai twice 
- I have been to Shanghai before

Have you ever been to ... 这个ever只是做加强语气。ever 会在以下情况作加强语气：
- 疑问句
- if 表示的假设句 If you ever do it again， I will punish you
- 有最高级的语句 He is the best student that I have ever taught

What a pity == what a shame 这里 shame 表 “遗憾”
