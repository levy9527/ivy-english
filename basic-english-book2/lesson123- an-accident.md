Sally and her husband, Jack, have both been driving for 3 years. Jack has always driven carefully. He has never been in an accident. 
Sally, however, has never been a good driver. She has already gotten into four accindents this year. 
Each time she has had an accident, she has claimed that it was not her fault. 
Yesterday, she drove into a tree. She blamed it on the tree, saying that she honked the horn, but the tree didn't get out of the way.

## Key Points

get into 遭遇
- Larry has gotten into trouble again

claim 还有夺去性命的意思，需要与 life 搭配：
- The earthquake claimed 21 lives.

be one's fault 某人的错误

be at fault for 谁的过错
- Who's at fault for starting the fight?

blame + 名词（坏事情）+ on + 名词（人或物）：归咎于
- the police blamed the accident on bad weather conditions.

blame sb. for sth. 因某事怪罪某人
- Don't blame me for your failures.

honk the horn. 按喇叭
- If I want the person in front of me to drive faster, I will honk the horn
- I think that's very rude!

现在完成进行时，与现在完成时的区别在于，如果动作一直持续，则最好用现在完成进行时：
- I've been learning English for five years。学英文五年了（现在还在学）

You're a sloppy man. 邋遢的

两个动词，没有 and 连接时，且第二个动词是 be 动词时，应该变成 being，而它又常能省略：
- I left home being a child and came back being an old man == I left home a child and came back an old man
