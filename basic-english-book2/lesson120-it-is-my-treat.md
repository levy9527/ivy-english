Have you ever eaten yet?

No.

I haven't, either. Let's have lunch together.

I didn't bring enough money.

Don't worry. It's my treat.

Thanks.

## Key Points

yet. 否定句中，用“尚...未”，疑问句中作“已经”，表强调。
- He has not come back yet
- Has he come back yet? 他回来了吗

相对的，already，用于肯定句中，表“已经”，疑问句中表强调惊讶
- He has come back alreadly
- Has he come back alrealy? 他真的已经回来了吗

either， 与 too 相对：
- either 用于否定句中
- too 用于肯定句中

同时，肯定简应句/否定简应句还可以用：so/nor，这两个一般要倒装，即动词在前，主语在后
- He is nice, so is she == she is too.
- He isn't nice, nor is she == she isn't either.

但如果两句都是同一个主语，则不用倒装（表示强调）：
- He is stupid
- So he is
