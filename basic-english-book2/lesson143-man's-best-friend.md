The dog is man's best friend. He can do many things for us. He can protect our homes. He can guide the bilnd. 
He is loyal to his master and never asks for a pay raise. The dog has also made many contributons to English. For example,
if there were no dogs, how could a husband tell his wife her cooking tastes like dog food?
How could the weatherman say, "it's raining cats and dogs?". So the next time a dog lifts a leg to your bicycle, don't kick him. 
Bend down and say, "Take your time!"

## Key Points
man之前不加冠词，表示人类; 若加冠词表示 某个人
- man is mortal 人类
- a man came to see you today 那个人

动物一般是it，但是可以拟人化，所以可以用he或者she

现在美语中习惯用 the + 名词(或形容词）, (取代不定冠词)来泛指同一类群体的人或者事物。
- the pen is mightier than the sword
- th blind == blind people 
- the rich == rich people 
- the poor == poor people 
- the homeless == homeless people 

The next time == next time，下次的时候
