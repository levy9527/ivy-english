I have a very superstitious friend, called Mack. He thinks that if he breaks a mirror, he will have seven years bad luck. 
As a result, he doesn't have any mirrors in his house. But not all superstitions are about bad luck. 
For instance, Mack also believes that if he drops his chopsticks, someone will inivite him to dinner.
Therefore, he is always dropping his chopsticks, waiting for an invitation.

## Key Points
I really had good luck today. I found one hundred dollars on the street.

I'm sorry. I accidentally dropped your radio and broke it.

Did you get invited to professor's retirement party?

本文主要学习全部否定与部分否定。

下面两句有人认为是同义, 属于部分否定（从谚语的角度来看，确实如此）：
- Not all students passed the exam. 并非全部通过（这个很好理解）
- All the students not passed the exam. 

全部否定最好使用 neither of/none of + 动词单数形式:
- Neither of my parents smokes.
- None of the three girls enjoys singing
