The teachings of Confucius tell us to be humble. People should not think too hightly of themselves. 
No matter how great one is, there's always someone greater. 
Therefore, we should be humble in our words and actions.
We should always remember the saying: pride comes before a fall.

action:

Judge a person by his actions and not by his appearance.

no matter how:
- 后面紧接形容词、副词，表示无论多么... no matter how hard he tried/no matter how nice he is
- 后面接主语，修饰的是动词，表示无论怎么做 no matter how he try, he won't succeed.

此时，however 可以替换
- however 不加逗号时，是无论多么...的意思 however nice he is, I don't like him


no matter what: 
- no matter what happens, I'll support you
- no matter what he says, I don't believe him
- no matter what he is, he must obey the law

以下是同义词：
- no matter what == whatever
- no matter when == whenever: whenever I see him, he is studying.
- no matter where == wherever: wherever he is, I'll find hime
- no matter who == whoever: whoever does it, it's none of my business
