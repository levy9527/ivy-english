Many people put off until tomorrow what they can do today. 
They always look for excuses to postpone doing something. In the end, it never gets done. 
If we leave things undone, we will eventually worry.
This will then cause unnecessary stress. Therefore, if you have this bad habit, it's best to get rid of it, and do things as soon as possible.
