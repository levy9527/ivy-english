This article talks about punctuality, or being on time.

For German- or English-speaking people, time maybe the utmost important thing.

The reason why they care about time maybe that there's an observatory at Greenwich, in London. GMT starts from there.

Being on time shows good manners. Being late, wasting others' time, is a sign of disorganizing living, an admission of being low-class. 
Worse, it maybe an insult to others, as if to say, "your time is not that important". This attitue borders on sin!

Being late may cause a bad result. Here're examples:
1. In business, you may lost your chance of getting promotion
2. In social dates, you may rejected by others to get along with them
3. In school class, you may give a bad impression on your teacher and your classmates

What should we do if being late is not avoided? 
Here're some pieces of advice:
1. tell people in advance, explaning why you're or will be late
2. apologize
3. assure that it will not happen again

Remember, "when in Rome, do as Romnans do." and to make a call ahead is never out of line.
