This article talks about precious stones and semi-precious stones, and gives us information and tips on gems and their purchase.

All authorities and experts will agree that there're four types of precious stones in the world. They're diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald.

Some experts may argue that there's fiveth type precious stone. That's pearl.

It's the quality rather than type determines the value of precious stone.

So what features contribute to the quality?

Firstly, the weight of precious stone. Secondly, the cutting style, like no scratch on the surface.

And then, the color, whether it's the same color throughout. Finally, the transparency, like no "cloudy". 

These attributes help to evaluate the price of precious stone.

In the end, you'd better follow the suggestion: don't make a deal with a stranger on the street, selling you "a good deal on gem".
