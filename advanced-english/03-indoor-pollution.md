This article talks about indoor pollution. 

It gives us a counterintuitive conclusion that staying indoors maybe more harmful to one's health than staying outdoors.

Why? Because there's indoor pollution. Chemicals in the air can be harmful to our health.

That's to say, we should put all pollution into perspective.

In the following, the article talks about where do the chemicals come from and what should we do to keep away from them.

First, the water we use contains chemicals. 

A reseach from University of Texas has shown that chemicals added to our water supply to kill harmful bacteria can have unwanted side effects. 

These chemicals can be released in to air and breathed in. Once inside our bodies, they affect our health adversely.

What's more, home activities, such as burning、cooking and even candles will release carbon monoxide. 

In addition, new furniture、new clothing、new equipment and new applied paint, which give off "new smell", are releasing harmful chemicals.

To pretect our health, we should open windows during good weather to flush stale air. In this point, the air conditioner maybe our enemy, not our friend.

In summary, we're neither safe at home nor in the office. We need further research to understand our new technological environment better.
