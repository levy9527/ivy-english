My girlfriend and I are going to get married this year. We're going to have a big wedding party. 
All our friends and relatives are going to come. We are going to have a traditional wedding. 
After the wedding we are going to live with my parents. We're going to be one big happy family.

## Key Points
be going to == will, 区别在于：
- will可以表示长期的一个情况: he will marry the girl ten years later
- will还用于在某种条件下会发生 I will get angry if you don't come
