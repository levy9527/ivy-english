Dan must take a day off tomorrow. He has to take care of his sick mother. He ought to talk to his boss, but he's afraid. His boss might get angry with him. 
What should Dan do? He can take the work home. This way, he can kill two birds with one stone.

## Key Points
must / have to 必须
- must 可用于道德/必务，you must love your country
- have to 可用于不得不（被勉强）的场景 I have to work this weekend

另外从时态上讲：
- must 只能用于现在或将来
- had to 可以用于过去时 I had to work last weekend

take a day off / take two days off 请一天/两天假

take care of / look after 照顾

ought to / should 应该
- what ought dan to do 注意疑问句 ought 与 to 是分开的

might 与 may 的区分在于可能性：
- you may be right, so I will take your advice
- you might be right, but I think my way will be better

get angry with / be angry with:
- get 强调生气的动作
- be 强调保持生气的状态

take the work home: 不加 to 是因为 home 是副词

take the work to his home 加 to 是因为此时 home 是名词

be at home: 在家 he is at home most of the time.

(in) this/that ways...这样. in 可省略

kill two birds with one stone: 一石二鸟，两全其美
