My hometown is not very modern, but it's beautiful. There's a big park in the center of my hometown. There's also a swimming pool there. It is next to the park.
My school is across from the swimming pool. They're all near my home.

In fact, there's no place like my hometown.

## Grammar Points
表示方位：
- near在什么什么的附近
- next to 紧邻 Don't move there the snake next to you.
- across from 在...对面
- in the center of 在...中心点

如果表示场所位置的介词在于句首，那么there是可以省略的:

Near my school there is a swimming pool == Near my school is a swimming pool
