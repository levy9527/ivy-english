Last weekend, my classmates and I went camping. We found a grassy spot beside a river. We put up our tents and make a campfire. Then we fished at the river.
We had only one fishing rod, so we took turns. After a while, we caught a big trout. Finally, we sat around the fire, roasted the fish and sang song. Camping is really fun!
