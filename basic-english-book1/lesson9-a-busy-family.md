It's a busy day at the Wangs' house. Mr. Wang is fixing his bike. Mrs. Wang is writing a letter. Tina is reading a book. Tony is exercising. 

Even the dog is budy. It's chasing a cat. The cat is running for its life.

The Wangs are busy, but they're having fun.   

## Grammar Points
at the Wangs' house.

at:
- house
- station
- post office
- grocery store

为什么是 Wangs' house 而不是 Wang's house？因为这里指的是 Wang 氏一家人，是专有名词复数形式的所有格，故先加 s 再加 '

have fun: 玩得开心，过得愉快
