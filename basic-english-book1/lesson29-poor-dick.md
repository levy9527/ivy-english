## Key Points
使用 one，避免重复

I don't like this red pen. Give me a yellow one.

because 后面接的是状语从句，类似的从句
- 放到主语后面时，不用加逗号
- 放到主语前面时，需要加逗号

示例：
- Although he is rich, I don't envy him == I don't envy him although he is rich
- If I have time, I will do it == I will do it if I have time

但注意区分 but，but 作为连词连接两个句子，一般而言，是要在 but 前面加逗号的：
- The food is good, but I have no appetite.
