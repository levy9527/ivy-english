The hare can run very fast, but the turtle can only walk slowly. One day, the hare proundly challenged the turtle to race. 
The hare started quickly, but stopped to take a nap every now and then. The turtle walks slowly but surely. While the hare was sleeping, the turtle passed him. 
Finally, the turtle won the race. In the end, it was rewarded for its perseverance. We can all learn a lesson from the turtle.
