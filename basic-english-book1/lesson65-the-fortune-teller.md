My friend Mike is a fortune-teller. He often tells me many things about my future. 
First, I'll become a father next year. Then, I'll get a promotion and earn a lot of money. Two years later, I'll buy a new car. 
Soon after that, I will be able to afford a new house. I'm not superstitious, but I hope he's right.


## Key Points

get a promotion. 升职

afford. vt. 付得起 与 can/be able to 搭配
- I can afford the new house
- I'm not able to afford the new house
- I will be able to afford the new house someday

superstitious. adj. 迷信的
- If you break a mirror, you'll have seven years of bad luck. Oh, you're just superstitious

一般将来时，现在多用 will，无论人称，这其实是美式用法
- I will become a father next year
- I shall do it（I/We 用 shall，英式用法）
