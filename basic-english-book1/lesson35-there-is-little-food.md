## Key Points
这一课主要讲的数量的形容词：
- 接可数名词: few, several(比 a few 多一点）, many
- 接不可数名词: little, much, a great deal of
- 以上两者都能接: plenty of, a lot of(lots of), some

注意语句的意味：
- a few 有几个（用于肯定）
- few 没几个（用于否定）
- quite a few（相当于 many)

little 与之类似：
- a little（用于肯定）
- little （用于否定）
- quite a little（相当于 much)

注意：much 多用于否定句中，肯定句常用 a lot of(lots of)、plenty of
- He doesn't have much money.
- He has a lot of money.
