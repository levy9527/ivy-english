This is my English book. It belongs to me. It is mine. 
That is your English book. It belongs to you. It is yours. 
Those books aren't ours. They belog to those boys over there. They're theirs.

Why do we all have different books? Because we belong to different classes. 

## Grammar Points
这课主要讲的是一些代词的功能:
- 单数，是this/that，复数是these/those
- 跟远近有关，this 搭配 here，taht 搭配 there
- 如果出现了一次代词的话，后面也可以用it去表示，句子更优，避免了重复。This is my English book. It(This) belongs to me. 

mine 是名词所有格，相当于名词，后面不可再接名词。而形容词所有格后面要接名词。更多名词所有格：
- its
- his
- whose
- 其他形容词所有格 + s

注意，whose 一词两用，既可以当形容词所有格，又可以当名词所有格：
- Whose dog is this? 这是谁的狗(This is whose dog)
- Whose is this dog? 这只狗是谁的(This dog is whose) —— 感觉太绕了，很少这么说

老美常在 here/there 前使用 over，表示强调。
