Judy is worried. She has nothing suitable to wear, so she puts on her best casual clothes. She goes to the interview. Guess what? Judy gets the job!

## Key Points
Guess What? 你猜怎么样？

something/anything/nothing 虽然是代词(没有复数形式），但却在形容词的前面：
- I have sth. important to tell you.
- I have nothing important to tell you.

except. prep. 除...以外。与全体集合词搭配(all, every, no, any)，表示整个集合中的例外：
- All the boys are good except him. (正确）
- Many boys are good except him.（错误）
