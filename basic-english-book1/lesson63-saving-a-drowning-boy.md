Ray was walking on the beach one summer day when he heard a little boy shout, "Help! Help!". The boy was drowning. Without thinking, Ray dove into the water. 
Soon he was swimming back to shore with the boy. Crowds of people were watching eagerly. After a while, the boy was breathing again. 
Then the boy sat up and said to Ray, "You're my hero."

过去进行时+ when，表示某个时刻正在发生的动作
- What was he doing then
- when I walk in he was eating

leave/come/go 这种来去的动词, 可用于过去进行时, 表示过去即将发生的事
- he told me he was leaving soon.
- he told me he would leave soon.

另外，注意到上文中，Ray heard a little boy shout。为什么这个shout的是用动词原形呢？

因为hear/see/feel这三类动词，他接了宾语以后，可以用动词原形，现在分词或者过去分词分别去做宾语补足语，那么他们强调的内容是不一样的
- I saw him steal my money。动词原形强调是确有其事在发生
- I saw him stealing my money。动词原形强调是确有其事在发生
- I saw him punished。过去分词强调是被动语态已经发生或者已经完成
