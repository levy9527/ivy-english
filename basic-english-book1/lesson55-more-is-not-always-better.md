Some people have more money than others. However, they're not necessarily happpier. On the other hand, some people are as poor as church mice, but they're happy.
In a way, these poor people are as rich as kings. Therefore, I always remember my father's words, "More is not always better."

## Key Points
not necessarily. 未必，并非必然的。
- The boss isn't necessarily always right.

words. （某人）说的话

穷得要命：
- as poor as a church mouse
- as poor as church mice

more:
- I have more friends than you. 这里 more 是形容词
- She is more beautiful than you. 这里 more 是副词
- He has a lot of money, but she has more. 这里 more 是代词

本课主要介绍：more ... than 与 as ... as 的用法（其实是类似的）
- she is more beautiful than you are == she is more beautiful than you
- he studies harder than I do == he studies harder than I 
- he came back earlier than I did == he came back earlier than I
- he came back as early as I did == he came back as early as I

由上可得：语法后面的助动词/be动词是可以省略的（平时使用的也就是省略的）
