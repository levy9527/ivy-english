Nobody is at home at the Wangs' house. Mr. Wang is working in his office. Mrs. Wang is shopping at the supermarket. 

Tony is sitting on the bus. He's on his way on the gym. Tina is studying at the library.

Rover is not at home, either. It's running around the neighborhood. It's not chasing Mrs. Lee's cat. It's chasing Mrs. Lee!
