My best friend Billy and I decided to learn English last year. We promised each other to work hard. We never failed to attend class. 
Billy always remembered to do his homework. I never forgot to do mine, either. Our English is pretty good now. It only proves that there's no gain whithout pain. 

## Key Points
promise sb. to do sth. 答应某人做...
- I promise my teacher to do my homework

fail to 未能
- Pual fail to get into the medical school

never fail to 一定会

attend. 参加
- attend class
- attend school

There's no gain without pain.

That's not the right way to learn English (这里的 to 短语是作形容词，修饰前面的名词）

pretty. 作副词表示相当的，语气比 very 要弱
