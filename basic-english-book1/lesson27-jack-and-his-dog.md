Jack seldom gets together with his friends. He usually stays at home with his pet dog, Lucky. They sometimes go for long walks in the park. 
Although Jack is often alone, he's never lonely. He always tells his friends that a dog is man's best friends.

## Key Points
不经常，其实 seldom 不地道，建议使用：
- rarely
- not very often

宠物：
- a pet dog
- a pet cat

上文中 go for a walk，因表示常态，把 a 省略，walk 使用复数形式。 另，散步也可叫 go for a stoll

man. 人类. 不需要加定冠词
