There're serveral foreign classmates in my class. John is American. He's from the United States. Laura is Spanish. She's from Spain.

Chen and Huang are Chinese, but they're not from China. They're from Malaysia. They're overseas Chinese.

We're from different countries, but we all get along well.

## Grammar Points
国籍，一般使用形容词，而不是使用可数名词，因为有些国家没有可数名词形式。

John is American == John is an American.

但 Laura is Spanish. 不能写成 Laura is a Spainish.

all 表示所有的，修饰的是三个或三个以上的人、东西。，相近的是 both，用来修饰两个人或东西：
- Both my parents can sing.
- All my parents can sing.（这句一般情况不太恰当，有暗指自己不止一对父母的意思）

get along 相处，后面可加 with + 名词:
- He has a bad temper. I can't get along with him.
