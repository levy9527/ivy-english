Something strange happened to me yesterday. On my way to school, I met a stranger. He stopped me and said, "you're Betty, aren't you?" "No," I replied.
He asked, "You know me, don't you?" "I don't," I answered. Then, he said, "You owe me $100, don't you?" I ran away.
At that moment, I remembered my mother's words: "never talk to strangers".

## Key Points
happen to + sb. 发生在某人身上：
- good things always happen to me

reply == answer 回答

own + sb + money 欠某人钱
- you still owe me fifty dollars

本课主要介绍反意疑问句的用法，主要思路：肯定句时，反问用否定；否定句，反问用肯定。

动词关系：
- be 动词，反问使用相应的否定形式
- 助动词，反问使用相应的否定形式
- 一般动词，反问使用 do 或 don't
- let's 句型，固定使用 shall. let's go eat, shall me?
- 动词原型开头的祈使句，使用 will：be quiet, will you? come here, will you?

指示代词：
- 如果主语是人，反问时使用代词。John is angry with me, isn't he?
- 如果主语是 this/that, those/these，反问使用 it/they: That is good, isn't is? These are beautiful, aren't they? 
- 如果是 there's/there're 句式，反问继续使用 there's/there're：there is a man there, isn't there?
