After my graduation, I went to Beijing to further my studies. I lived there for three years. At first, I was haapy, but later, I was frustrated and depressed.
I was homesick all the time. Although the people were friendly, I missed my family, my frineds, and the lifestyle in my hometown.

## Key Points
frustrated. adj. 受挫折的

depressed. adj. 沮丧的

after 可以作为介词，也可以作为连词(before 同理）：
- after my graduation...
- after I graduated...

at first，表示一开始，与 later 相对：
- at first, he was hardworking, but later, he was lazy.

first 常与 second 搭配，适用于列举一、二、三的场景：
- David is great in ways. First, He never lies. Second(ly), he is helpful(乐于助人）.
