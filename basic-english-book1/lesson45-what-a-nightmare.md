Jeff had a terrible day. He missed the train to work. Moreover, he had to wait a long time for next train. As a matter of fact, he waited for two hours. 
To make matters worse, he left his briefcase on the train. As a result, he had to go to the police station. Poor Jeff never got to work that day. What a nightmare!
